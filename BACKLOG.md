 1. Make the snowplow more fun to drive:

    - When player has plow pointed almost straight along road, make automatic adjustments in orientation to keep it moving along the road (don't allow plow to drift slowly to edge)
    - Raise plow for more speed; lower plow to pick up snow
    - Let W/S increase speed gradually to top speed, slow down gradually when released
    - Add audio cues:
        * When straight on road
        * For current speed


 1. Correct geometry of the art

 1. Fancy new features

     * Temporary floodlight
     * Being chased
     * One player chases or blocks another
     * Cyclists, pedestrians, motorists, and other obstacles
     * Map gradually gets lighter as time passes? (start at night)
     * Clock?
     * Cooperative mode?
