 1. Snowplow that can be steered (DONE)

 2. Headlights to uncover map (Peter, Norman)

 3. Snowplow to be limited to roads on map (Vivian, Kaelen)

 4. Ability to pick up snow (Vivian, Kaelen)





 5. Second player with different key controls

 6. Scoreboard: who has more snow

 7. Restart button

 8. Detect game over

 9. Make the snowplow more fun to drive:

    - When player has plow pointed almost straight along road, make automatic adjustments in orientation to keep it moving along the road (don't allow plow to drift slowly to edge)
    - Raise plow for more speed; lower plow to pick up snow
    - Let W/S increase speed gradually to top speed, slow down gradually when released
    - Add audio cues:
        * When straight on road
        * For current speed


 9. Correct geometry of the art

10. Fancy new features

     * Temporary floodlight
     * Being chased
     * One player chases or blocks another
     * Cyclists, pedestrians, motorists, and other obstacles
     * Map gradually gets lighter as time passes? (start at night)
     * Clock?
     * Cooperative mode?
